Transformer-based Tabular Learning (TTLL) introduces a powerful attention mechanism that allows the model to understand complex feature relationships, which traditional models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Logistic Regression often overlook. While traditional algorithms treat features independently or rely on fixed interaction patterns, TTLL dynamically weighs feature importance, enabling it to adapt to various data contexts—especially critical in irrigation systems where environmental variables interact non-linearly. Unlike Random Forests, which struggle with feature hierarchy or Logistic Regression, which assumes linearity, TTLL captures both global and local dependencies within data. It also scales well with high-dimensional inputs without manual feature engineering. TTLL models have shown improved generalization, reducing overfitting risks due to built-in dropout and layer normalization. Accuracy metrics often exceed 91%, significantly higher than typical ensemble methods. Additionally, the model’s attention weights offer interpretable insights into which features influence irrigation decisions. This helps in both transparency and fine-tuning recommendations. Overall, TTLL brings robustness, adaptability, and precision—making it superior for modern, data-driven agricultural advisory systems.
